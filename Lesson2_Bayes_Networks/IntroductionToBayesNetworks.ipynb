    "**Bayesian Networks** or **BNs** are one of the basic representations of probabilistic graphical models. BNs are **directed acyclic graphs** or **DAGs** which attempt to capture the **independence structure** of the distribution. Taking advantage of the independency structure of the distribution can greatly reduce the computational complexity of inference on the graphic model. \n",
