    "in the previous lesson we explored directed Bayes networks (BNs). BNs are directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) which can represent causality with many probability distributions. Further, BNs can express independencies of probability distributions. However, there is no unique representation of independencies. Many BNs can exhibit the same independency structure, but with different causal relationships. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we will turn our attention to another class of probabilistic graphical models known as **Markov networks** (**MNs**) or **Markov graphical models**. Markov graphic models are not directed graphs. Yet, like BNs, Markov graphical models can represent probability distributions including the independencies. In fact, as you will see, there are methods to map from BNs to Markov networks and back. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Graph separation criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "You can develop a useful view of the relationship between BNs and MNs with the **D-separation** criteria, **directed-separation** criteria. First, we need to introduce a definition:  \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Definition:** An **imorality** in a directed graph $G$ occurs where either; a) there is a directed edge between $X$ and $Y$, or b) $X$ and $Y$ are both parents of the same note $Z$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to a concept of a **moralized graph** that relates a directed BN to an undirected MN:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Definition:** A **moral graph**, $M(G)$, of a BN structure, $G$ over $X$ is the **undirected graph** over $X$ that contains an undirected edge between $X$ and $Y$ if; a) there is a directed edge between $X$ and $Y$, or b) $X$ and $Y$ are both parents of the same note $Z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads us to a corollary of relating the independencies of the directed BN to the independencies of a MN:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Corollary:** Given a distribution $P_B$ such that $B$ is a parameterization on a graph $G$, then $M(G)$ is an I-map for $P_B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does all of this mean? In summary, we can create an MN with the same independencies as a BN. The example in the Figure below will help to illustrate this idea. \n",

    "<center> **Example of Graph Moralization** </center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Referring to the above illustration: \n",
    "1. The original DAG is shown on the left. The variable Z is the evidence variable. Z is said to **block** the path from X to W. \n",
    "2. The undirected **ancestral** graph is shown in the center. Since W has a blocked path in the DAG it is not part of the ancestral graph. \n",
    "3. We can make the following assertion about the DAG; $P(X,U\\ \\| Z) = P(X\\ \\| Z)\\ P( U\\ |\\ Z)$.  This situation is an **immorality** since X and U are parents of Z. In other words, X and U are independent given evidence Z, which **blocks** the path from X and U. The graph is **moralized** by adding an edge between X and U as shown on the right. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the two definitions and the corollary, the resulting moralized undirected graph has the same independencies as the original DAG. If the DAG is an I-map of the distribution the undirected graph will also be an I-map. "
