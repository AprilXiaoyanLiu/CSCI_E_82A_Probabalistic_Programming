    "We have seen several approaches to representation of probabilistic graphical models. Now, we will turn our attention to **inference algorithms**. The goal of inference is to compute the **posterior distribution** of one or more variables in the model given **evidence**. Alternatively, we can say that inference is used to return results to a **query** on the model. \n",

    "\n",

While it is true, there are no general algorithms for solving the inference problem, there are many practical and widely applicable cases for which efficient inference algorithms exist. \n",

    "The key to reducing the computational complexity of graphical model inference algorithms is use of independencies. The naive approach is to simple the full table of marginal distributions of the graph variables. This approach has combinatorial or NP complexity. By combining conditional probabilities with evidence, the complexity of marginal influence can be significantly reduced. \n",

    "The algorithms we will explore take advantage of special structures commonly found in model graphs. Part of the tick is to rearrange the graph to create the desired structure. These algorithms combined with conditional probabilities and evidence result in even large scale models becoming tractable.    "

    "There is another way to create an efficient message passing algorithm. This method is known as the **junction tree algorithm**. The junction tree algorithm can factorize graphs that do not have a tree structure initially. Thus, the junction tree algorithm is not only efficient, but quite flexible. \n",
    "\n",
    "The general steps to of the junction tree algorithm are:\n",
    "1. Moralize the graph, following the process we have already applied.\n",
    "2. Triangulate the graph to transform multiply connected graphs to trees. \n",
    "3. Build a clique tree from the transformed graph. The clique tree is composed of clique variables and factors. \n",
    "4. Propagate the probabilities by local message passing from either factors to variables or variables and factors. \n",
