# Welcome to CSCI E-82A  

Real-world machine intelligence and machine learning operates in an uncertain world. Probabilistic programming encompasses a range of algorithms for making decisions and inferences under uncertainty. Probabilistic programming has multiple uses in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Probabilistic programming methods arise in problems in many areas including, scheduling, robotics, natural language processing and image understanding. 
The focus of this course is developing understanding of the theory and gaining hands on experience with probabilistic representation, leaning and inference methods for planning and classification.  Hands on exercises will be done using Python APIs for several powerful packages.    

The course is built around the three pillars of machine learning and artificial intelligence; representation, learning and inference. This course will survey a number of powerful probabilistic programming methods for representation, learning, and inference:    
1.	Review of probability and inference.   
2.	Representations for probabilistic models.   
3.	Learning in probabilistic models.   
4.	Bayesian graphical models.   
5.	Markov decision processes and planning.   
6.	Partially observable Markov decision processes.   
7.	Unsupervised probabilistic models, time permitting.   
8.	Reinforcement learning methods.
